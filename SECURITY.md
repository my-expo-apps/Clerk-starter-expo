# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report issues privately by emailing the maintainer:

- `security@REPLACE-ME.example`

Include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Any relevant logs (redact secrets)
- Your suggested fix (optional)

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours**.
